/// Trait that abstracts account retrieval for Titan.
///
/// A venue receives an `&dyn AccountsCache` during `update_state()` and uses it
/// to retrieve all required on-chain accounts.  
///
/// Implementers must satisfy the following:
///
/// - **Thread-safety:** Trait objects must be `Send + Sync`.
/// - **Deterministic ordering:** `get_accounts()` must return accounts in the
///   same order as the input pubkeys.
/// - **Graceful failure:** Missing accounts should trigger structured errors.
/// - **Caching optional:** The trait *allows* caching but does not require it.
///
/// Typical implementations include:
/// - `RpcClientCache` (network-backed, concurrent cache)
/// - Test harnesses using fixed HashMaps
/// - Simulators like LiteSVM or custom in-process banks
